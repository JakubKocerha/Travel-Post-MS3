# Arctic Travels

## User Experience (UX)

---

### First-time visitor goals

1. As a first-time visitor, potential, present, or future traveler or tourist, I want to get aggregated information about the unconventional travel destinations, in this case, traveling the arctic areas in Europe. My curiosity leans over the real stories of real people excluded from marketing, promotion, or user data collecting. I want to be a part of an independent web community.

2. As a first-time visitor, I want to have easy access to the relevant information, minimum commercial ads, and meaningful content published by each registered user. Clean, simple, relatively respectful to my privacy, and adequate is precisely what I am looking for. 

3. As a first-time visitor, I want to get as much information as possible to gain confidence and personal security to travel to remote areas..

4. As a first-time contributor to the website, I want easy access to the posting form, easy registration, login, deletion, and search functionalities.

### Returning and frequent visitor goals

1. As a returning visitor, I want to fully enjoy the complete functionality of the web and read new/updated posts, stories, and information I and others could benefit from. I want to feel the site provides me a global range of information from the Arctic, not explicitly focused on any activity. I want to think that the scope of information suits anyone searching for different ways of traveling, from mountain hiking and extreme sports to fully facilitated and accessible environments. 

2. As a returning visitor, I want to read others' posts, use them as a guidebook to the less known, explored, or described areas. 

3. As a returning/frequent visitor, I want to add new stories, tips, and suggestions empowering the site community to be a continuously evolving and independent travel hub for all intending to visit the arctic. 

4. As a returning/frequent visitor, I want to feel I can always revive my memories from spectacular travels and mutually share them with others.

## Design of the site
Under the UX goals, the developer has decided not to overload the content. The Post design should feel intuitive and provide comfortable contrasts to the user. The colors chosen should reflect mysterious unknown places with hints of nature-based shades. 

### Color scheme
